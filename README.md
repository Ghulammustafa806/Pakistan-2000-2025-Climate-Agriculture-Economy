Pakistan Climate & Economy Analysis (2000–2025)
This project presents a powerful visual analysis of Pakistan's climate and economic trends over 25 years.
We use Python, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to create grouped countplots that highlight key environmental patterns.
Each plot compares low, medium, and high levels of critical indicators like CO₂ emissions, disaster frequency, and water stress.
Data is binned into readable categories for easy insight and comparison.
Trends are grouped by year or category for clear storytelling and group analysis.
Designed in a 3×3 plot layout, this project mimics modern business intelligence dashboards.
The dataset is fully cleaned and categorized using pandas.
Perfect for climate researchers, economists, and data science learners.
All visuals are reproducible and notebook-ready in Jupyter.# Pakistan-2000-2025-Climate-Agriculture-Economy
